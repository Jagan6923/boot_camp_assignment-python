I completed an assignment using Python, which was given by the LETS UPGRADE Python Bootcamp.

Assignment: Animal Sounds
Create a simple program that represents different animals and their sounds. Follow the steps below to complete the assignment:
Step 1: Create a base class Animal with a method make_sound(). This method should print a generic animal sound.
Step 2: Create two subclasses Dog and Cat, each inheriting from the Animal class.
Step 3: Override the make_sound() method in the Dog and Cat classes with their respective sounds (bark and meow).
Step 4: Implement a function called animal_sound_in_zoo() that takes an animal object as a parameter and calls its make_sound() method.
Step 5: Create instances of Dog and Cat classes and call the animal_sound_in_zoo() function with these instances as arguments to observe their unique sounds.    Hints:
You can use the print() function to display the output.
Remember to use the super() function inside the make_sound() method of the derived classes to call the base class's make_sound() method.
